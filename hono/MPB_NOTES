changed the entry for 0.0 energy for the merged_oh_no_transhono_7.dat
from 2.19681E+01 to 0.0 to avoid this error:


Model::Rotd::Rotd : zero flux energy is not reached
terminate called after throwing an instance of 'Error::Input'
Aborted (core dumped)


which happens when there's not at least one 0.0 entry in the .dat file


-------------
the file in this directory runs on burkelab3

I had also tried running the original MESS files (without the tweak above)
on burkelab2 initially and it gave an error having to do with finding math libraries
(which implies MESS wasn't installed correctly rather than an input file issue -- not sure what's going on there, but it works on burkelab3 so we can do the calculations on burkelab3)
